# SmartFrame Downloader
Enables the download of high-resolution PNG images from a DRM-protected SmartFrame image. 

### This should not be used to bypass copyright restrictions. 
That being said, many SmartFrame-protected images - such as those in Historic England's [Aerial Photo Explorer](https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/archive/collections/aerial-photos/) remain under no copyright, yet are protected. Don't believe me? [Historic England said so!](https://x.com/HistoricEngland/status/1507377198747033608)

I am not responsible if you do something illegal (in whatever jurisdiction you live in) with this code. I am merely underlining the ineffectiveness of any DRM like this, and underlining the fact that many copyright-free photos are arbitrarily protected. 

## Contents / How to Use
The main file is `tampermonkey.js`, which is the code for the Tampermonkey script. Many detailed tutorials explaining how to install a Tampermonkey script can be found online.

The script will display a nice button if a smart-frame is detected, and clicking it will download the image. Note that it will refresh the page and take a few seconds for the image to actually download â€” but it will download nonetheless.
